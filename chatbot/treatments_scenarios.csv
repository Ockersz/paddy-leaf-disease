blast,Baseline integrated blast management,general,any,any,cultural,"Avoid very late planting and try to synchronise planting with neighbours. Maintain recommended spacing so air can move through the canopy and leaves dry quickly. Plough under or remove heavily infected straw instead of leaving thick residues on the soil surface.","synchronised planting;spacing;residue management;baseline"
blast,Nursery seedlings with blast lesions,nursery,rainy_humid,any,variety_seed,"Where nursery seedlings show typical blast lesions, avoid keeping the nursery waterlogged and ensure good spacing so leaves dry quickly. For the next crop, use certified seed, treat seed with an approved fungicide where recommended, and avoid sowing too densely in trays or beds.","nursery;seedling;blast lesions;seed treatment;rainy nursery"
blast,Vegetative crop with leaf blast under humid weather,vegetative,rainy_humid,flooded,chemical_biological,"When leaf blast is spreading fast in a vegetative crop under wet, cloudy conditions with standing water, use a need-based protective fungicide recommended locally (often triazole or strobilurin-type). Ensure good coverage of upper leaves, drain excess water if possible, and avoid repeated sprays beyond label guidance.","leaf blast;wet;cloudy;standing water;fungicide spray"
blast,Lush vegetative crop with heavy nitrogen,vegetative,normal,any,nutrient_water,"If the crop is very lush and dark green due to heavy nitrogen, skip additional top-dressings and focus on balanced N–P–K in future seasons. Split nitrogen into smaller doses and avoid one large early application that makes foliage highly blast-susceptible.","lush crop;dark green;too much nitrogen;heavy urea"
blast,Upland or AWD field with blast in dry spells,vegetative,dry_drought,awd,nutrient_water,"In upland or alternate-wetting-and-drying fields with blast and intermittent drought, avoid stressing the crop further. Maintain moderate soil moisture (do not let the soil crack severely) and apply balanced fertiliser rather than heavy nitrogen. Avoid late rescue nitrogen that triggers very lush, blast-prone regrowth.","upland;AWD;alternate wetting;drought;cracked soil"
blast,High humidity around booting and heading,booting_heading,rainy_humid,flooded,chemical_biological,"When blast risk is high around booting to heading under wet, cloudy conditions, consider a need-based protective fungicide spray using products recommended locally. Aim to protect the flag leaf and emerging panicle; follow label rates and intervals strictly and avoid excessive nitrogen ahead of this stage.","booting;heading;flag leaf;panicle;humid;fungicide spray"
blast,Late-season neck blast near harvest,reproductive,rainy_humid,any,monitoring,"If neck blast appears close to harvest, further fungicide sprays are usually of limited benefit. Focus on careful harvest and threshing to salvage as much grain as possible, and plan stronger preventive measures next season (resistant varieties, planting time, nitrogen management and timely fungicide where justified).","neck blast;near harvest;late season;monitoring;planning"

brown_spot,Nutrient-related brown spot in dry spells,vegetative,dry_drought,dry,nutrient_water,"Under dry, nutrient-poor conditions with many brown spots, prioritise improving nutrition and water: apply recommended nitrogen and potassium, and resume timely irrigation if water is available. Where possible add organic matter or a silicon source to build soil health over the longer term.","dry spell;no rain;nutrient stress;poor soil;dry field"
brown_spot,Seedling or nursery brown spot with suspect seed,nursery,any,any,variety_seed,"If seedlings in the nursery show brown leaf blight and seed-borne brown spot is suspected, use certified seed next crop and treat seed with hot water or an approved fungicidal seed treatment according to local recommendations. Avoid very dense sowing and ensure good drainage in the nursery.","nursery;seedling;seed-borne;seed treatment;dense nursery"
brown_spot,Severe leaf blighting in main field under humid weather,vegetative,rainy_humid,flooded,chemical_biological,"When brown spot is widespread with severe leaf blighting in a humid, poorly drained field and the crop still has time to respond, a single or limited number of foliar fungicide sprays (according to local labels) can be used as support, together with correcting nutrition and water stress.","severe lesions;widespread;field covered;fungicide;wet field"
brown_spot,Moderate brown spot under normal irrigation,vegetative,normal,flooded,cultural,"In normally irrigated fields with moderate brown spot, emphasise field hygiene and crop vigour: maintain good land levelling, remove volunteer rice and weeds, and avoid long periods of shallow stagnant water. Rotate with non-rice crops or fallow where possible to reduce carry-over inoculum.","normal irrigation;levelling;weeds;volunteer rice;crop rotation"
brown_spot,Grain filling stage with noticeable brown spot,reproductive,normal,any,monitoring,"If brown spot is visible but the crop is already at grain filling or close to maturity, additional fungicide sprays offer limited economic return. Focus on nutrition and water management to support grain filling, and plan stronger nutrient and seed management for the next season.","grain filling;near harvest;brown spots;monitoring;economic return"
brown_spot,Humid weather on low-fertility soils,general,rainy_humid,any,nutrient_water,"On low-fertility soils under humid conditions where brown spot recurs, review soil tests and apply recommended rates of nitrogen, potassium and, where appropriate, silicon or organic amendments. Combine this with improved seed health and residue management between seasons.","low fertility;humid;recurring;soil health;organic matter"

hispa,Early nursery or young crop infestation,nursery,any,any,cultural,"In nurseries or very young crops, clip and destroy heavily scraped or mined leaves to physically remove eggs and larvae. Avoid dense seeding and maintain weed-free bunds and field margins to reduce beetle refuges. Do not keep nursery beds continuously waterlogged.","nursery;young seedlings;clipping;leaf mining;dense nursery"
hispa,Vegetative crop with high adult beetle activity and normal weather,vegetative,normal,any,nutrient_water,"If the crop is very lush with high nitrogen and many hispa adults under normal weather, avoid further nitrogen applications and keep water and weeds well managed. This reduces overly tender foliage and alternate hosts that favour the pest.","lush crop;excess urea;weedy bunds;normal weather"
hispa,Confirmed damaging infestation over large patches in humid weather,vegetative,rainy_humid,any,chemical_biological,"When scraping damage and mines are widespread over large field patches in humid weather and economic loss is likely, use a selective insecticide or neem-based product recommended locally, applied early and uniformly. Avoid repeated broad-spectrum sprays that kill natural enemies.","many scraped leaves;large patches;heavy damage;insecticide;humid"
hispa,Dry spell with stressed crop and hispa injury,vegetative,dry_drought,dry,cultural,"During dry spells when the crop is already stressed and hispa scraping is evident, prioritise irrigation or moisture conservation where possible and remove heavily scraped leaves on field edges. Avoid harsh blanket insecticide sprays that may flare secondary pests when plants are weak.","dry crop;water stress;dry spell;stressed plants"
hispa,Late-season hispa near harvest,reproductive,any,any,monitoring,"If most hispa damage appears close to harvest, further insecticide treatment is usually not economical. Focus on timely harvest to minimise lodging and shattering, and strengthen early-season preventive measures (balanced nitrogen, weed-free bunds, conservation of natural enemies) for the next crop rather than late corrective sprays.","near harvest;late season;lodging;not economical"
hispa,Monitoring and IPM in low to moderate infestations,general,any,any,monitoring,"When hispa scraping is present but still at low to moderate levels, regularly sample leaves to track damage and adult numbers. Conserve natural enemies by avoiding unnecessary insecticide sprays and consider botanicals (for example neem-based products) if populations begin to rise.","low infestation;scouting;natural enemies;IPM;monitoring"

dead_heart,Preventive stem borer management before planting,general,any,any,cultural,"After harvest, plough in or remove stubbles and kill ratoons to destroy stem borer carry-over. Plan for synchronised planting with neighbours and avoid very late planting that exposes young crops to peak moth flights.","stubbles;ratoons;land preparation;before planting;synchronised planting"
dead_heart,Nursery or early seedbed with high egg masses,nursery,rainy_humid,flooded,monitoring,"In nurseries where stem borer egg masses are frequently observed, clip seedling tips before transplanting and destroy the clippings. Avoid keeping nursery beds constantly flooded and monitor nearby lights or pheromone traps to track moth flights.","egg masses;nursery;clipping;light trap;pheromone trap"
dead_heart,Dead hearts appearing at vegetative stage below threshold,vegetative,normal,flooded,monitoring,"When scattered dead hearts appear, record the percentage of affected tillers or hills. If levels are below local thresholds, focus on removing heavily damaged tillers and maintaining good crop vigour rather than spraying immediately.","few dead hearts;low percentage;monitoring;recording"
dead_heart,Dead hearts or whiteheads above threshold,vegetative,any,any,chemical_biological,"If dead hearts or whiteheads exceed local economic thresholds and cultural or biological measures are insufficient, apply a recommended stem borer insecticide (for example chlorantraniliprole-based) at the correct growth stage and water depth, following label guidance.","many dead hearts;whiteheads;above threshold;insecticide"
dead_heart,Late-season whiteheads near harvest,reproductive,any,any,monitoring,"If most symptoms are whiteheads appearing close to harvest, further insecticide treatment is usually not economical. Focus on harvesting in time to minimise shattering, and strengthen off-season and early-season preventive measures rather than late corrective sprays.","whiteheads;near harvest;late season;not economical"

tungro,Baseline tungro prevention in endemic areas,general,any,any,variety_seed,"In tungro-prone zones, grow tungro-resistant or tolerant varieties and avoid highly susceptible ones. Use clean seed from healthy fields and avoid bringing seedlings from areas with known tungro outbreaks.","tungro-prone;resistant variety;clean seed;avoid susceptible"
tungro,High leafhopper pressure in nursery or early crop,nursery,rainy_humid,any,chemical_biological,"Where monitoring shows high green leafhopper populations at nursery or early tillering stages and tungro risk is known, use locally recommended insecticides targeting the vectors early in crop growth. Combine this with roguing of early yellow, stunted clumps.","many leafhoppers;early season;nursery;yellow clumps;vector control"
tungro,Existing tungro patches within the field,vegetative,any,any,cultural,"When tungro patches are already present, rogue and destroy infected hills promptly and maintain a rice-free or low-rice period between crops if possible. Focus management on preventing further spread rather than curing already infected plants.","yellow patches;stunted clumps;field edges;roguing"
tungro,Vegetative crop in tungro-prone area with few suspect plants,vegetative,normal,any,monitoring,"In vegetative crops in tungro-prone areas where only a few suspect plants are seen, monitor leafhopper populations and remove suspicious yellow, stunted clumps early. Avoid unnecessary insecticide sprays that may disrupt beneficial insects if vector numbers are low.","suspect plants;few yellow hills;monitoring;leafhopper counts"
tungro,Planning rice-free or low-rice periods between seasons,general,dry_drought,any,cultural,"Where tungro recurs frequently, plan a rice-free or low-rice period between seasons over as wide an area as possible, combined with destruction of volunteer rice and alternate hosts on bunds and canals. This reduces both virus and vector carry-over.","rice-free period;fallow;volunteer rice;bund weeds;carry-over"

normal,Healthy crop – keep it that way,general,any,any,ipm,"For a healthy crop, maintain recommended varieties, certified seed, good land levelling, balanced fertilisation, timely irrigation, and regular scouting. Address small problems early so that pests and diseases do not reach damaging levels.","healthy crop;no disease;preventive IPM;balanced fertiliser"
normal,After heavy rain or flooding but no disease yet,general,rainy_humid,flooded,cultural,"Where fields have been flooded or waterlogged but leaves are still healthy, drain excess water as soon as possible, repair bunds and channels, and avoid working in very wet fields to reduce mechanical injury. Resume normal irrigation schedules once soil structure recovers.","flooded field;heavy rain;waterlogged;drainage;bund repair"
normal,Dry spell with healthy but stressed crop,general,dry_drought,dry,cultural,"During prolonged dry spells when plants still look healthy but soil is cracking, prioritise moisture conservation (for example small bunds, reducing leakage) and avoid heavy late nitrogen applications that could burn or lodge plants when rain returns.","dry spell;cracked soil;moisture conservation;late nitrogen"
normal,Organic or low-chemical farmer,general,any,any,ipm,"For farmers aiming to minimise chemical inputs, emphasise resistant or tolerant varieties, crop rotation where possible, regular field scouting, conservation of natural enemies, and timely cultural practices (for example weeding, residue management, water control) to keep pest and disease pressure low without routine sprays.","organic;low chemical;natural enemies;rotation;preventive"
