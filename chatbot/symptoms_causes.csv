normal,"Healthy rice with no obvious disease.","Leaves are uniformly green with no distinct spots, streaks or blighted areas.","Leaf blades are smooth and intact, with even green colour appropriate to the crop stage. No circular or elongated lesions, no water-soaked areas, no whitish or necrotic patches, and no downy or fuzzy growth on either surface. Leaf edges are clean without burning, tattering or skeletonising.","Plants show normal height, tillering and leaf posture for the variety and growth stage. No stunting or patchy areas of dead or yellowed plants in the field. Panicle emergence and grain filling appear normal when in reproductive stages.","none","No specific pathogen or pest is involved. A healthy crop results from well-adapted varieties, balanced fertilisation, timely planting, good water management and effective weed control.","Good variety–site match, balanced fertilisation, appropriate planting time, adequate but not excessive water, minimal pest and weed pressure, and absence of extreme weather stress favour healthy crop growth.","uniform green; no spots; no streaks; no lesions; no chlorosis; no necrosis; smooth blades; normal turgor"
blast,"A major fungal disease that produces characteristic spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and can also damage nodes and panicles.","Spots begin as small whitish or grey-green flecks that expand into spindle-shaped leaf lesions with grey or off-white centres and brown to reddish-brown margins.","Lesions are often elongated and aligned with the leaf axis. Under heavy infection, many lesions coalesce, leaving large burned-looking areas and dry leaf tips. On susceptible varieties entire leaves or even patches of the field can look scorched. Collar, node and neck infections can also occur.","At tillering, plants may appear patchy with severely blasted leaves among healthy ones. At panicle stage, neck blast can cause blank or partially filled panicles that turn whitish and remain erect, leading to high yield loss.","fungal","Blast is caused by the fungus *Magnaporthe oryzae* (also known as *Pyricularia oryzae*). It thrives in humid, cloudy weather with frequent leaf wetness, and is favoured by dense stands, excessive nitrogen, susceptible varieties and abundant infected crop residues.","Cool to warm temperatures with high humidity, frequent rain or dew, dense planting, heavy single nitrogen doses, continuous rice with infected straw, and late or staggered planting in an area all favour blast epidemics.","spindle lesions; grey centre; brown margin; elongated leaf spots; coalescing lesions; burned leaf tips; neck blast"
brown_spot,"A common fungal disease that produces numerous brown lesions of varying size on leaves, especially under poor nutrition or stress.","Leaf blades show many small circular to oval brown spots, often with a darker margin and lighter or greyish centre.","Lesions range from tiny specks to larger eye-spot type lesions with a distinct chocolate-brown border and pale centre. A yellow halo may surround older spots. Under severe infection leaves may yellow and dry from the tip downward, giving the field a rusty or scorched appearance.","Plants may be stunted with fewer tillers and poorly filled grains, especially when the disease starts early and coincides with nutrient or water stress. Seedlings can show leaf blight and poor stand if seed-borne inoculum is high.","fungal","Brown spot is mainly caused by the fungus *Bipolaris oryzae*. It is strongly associated with low soil fertility (especially nitrogen and sometimes potassium or silicon), drought stress, use of infected seed and poorly managed fields.","Low soil fertility, especially nitrogen and potassium deficiency, drought or irregular water supply, poorly prepared and weedy fields, continuous rice with infected straw on the surface, and planting of infected seed all favour brown spot.","small brown spots; circular or oval lesions; darker margin light centre; eye-spot lesions; yellow halo; tip drying; rusty leaves"
hispa,"An insect pest (rice hispa beetle) that scrapes chlorophyll from leaves, causing whitish streaks and skeletonised leaves.","The upper leaf surface shows narrow, whitish, linear streaks running more or less parallel to the veins where adults have scraped off green tissue.","With increasing damage, many streaks coalesce. Leaves appear bleached or silvery from above and may break or tear at scraped areas. Grub feeding inside the leaf creates translucent mines and blister-like patches, especially near the tips.","Heavily attacked plants look pale and ragged, with reduced leaf area and overall vigour. In severe outbreaks, large patches of the field appear scorched or burnt from a distance, though the pattern is more uniform than fungal spotting.","insect","Hispa damage is caused by adult beetles scraping the leaf surface and larvae mining inside the leaf tissue. Outbreaks are promoted by lush, nitrogen-rich crops, dense planting, grassy weeds on bunds and previous infestations that leave carry-over populations.","Hot, humid weather combined with lush, heavily fertilised rice, dense stands, weedy field margins and previous season infestations favour hispa build-up. Disruption of natural enemies by broad-spectrum insecticides can also encourage outbreaks.","white narrow streaks; scraped upper surface; parallel to veins; skeletonised leaves; translucent mines; blister patches; scorched field appearance"
dead_heart,"A symptom usually caused by stem borer attack, where the central shoot dies while outer leaves remain green for a time.","In affected tillers the central leaf turns yellow then brown and can be easily pulled out, leaving a hollow or chewed base inside the stem.","Leaf blades on the dead central tiller dry out earlier than those on surrounding healthy tillers. There may be feeding scars or small entry holes near the base of the tiller. Later in the season, similar internal feeding at panicle stage causes “whiteheads” – blank, whitish panicles.","At vegetative stages, scattered hills or patches show dead central shoots (dead hearts) while outer tillers look relatively healthy. At reproductive stages, whiteheads appear where the panicle emerges but remains empty and whitish, leading directly to yield loss.","insect","Dead hearts and whiteheads in rice are most commonly caused by stem borers (e.g. *Scirpophaga* spp.). Larvae bore into stems and feed internally, cutting off nutrient and water flow to the central shoot or panicle.","High stem borer populations are favoured by continuous rice, leftover ratoons and stubbles, heavy nitrogen use, unsynchronised planting and absence of natural enemies. Calm, humid conditions favour moth activity and egg laying on young rice.","dead central tiller; central leaf dries; leaf easily pulled out; hollow stem base; feeding damage near base; dead hearts; whiteheads at panicle stage"
tungro,"A virus disease transmitted by leafhoppers that causes orange-yellow discoloration, stunting and reduced tillering.","Leaves show yellow to orange-yellow discoloration, often starting at the tip and progressing toward the base, sometimes with mottled or patchy colour.","Interveinal areas may appear pale or yellow while veins remain relatively greener. Small dark or rusty spots or streaks can occur on affected leaves. Leaves become more droopy and may roll slightly, giving a wilted appearance.","Plants are clearly stunted with fewer, shorter tillers and reduced root growth. Panicles, if produced, are fewer and bear small, poorly filled grains. Patches of tungro-infected plants tend to appear first at field edges or near earlier-planted fields and can spread inward.","viral","Tungro is caused by a complex of rice tungro viruses, transmitted mainly by green leafhoppers. Once a plant is infected there is no cure; damage depends heavily on the growth stage at infection and the number of infected hills.","Presence of tungro virus in volunteer rice and weeds, abundant leafhopper vectors, unsynchronised planting, lack of rice-free fallow and heavy nitrogen use that favours vectors all contribute to tungro epidemics.","yellow to orange leaves; tip to base yellowing; interveinal chlorosis; rusty spots; droopy leaves; stunted tillers; tungro patches"
